        title: "1. What is a Trademark?",
        content: `
### Simple Explanation
A trademark is a unique identifier for your brand. It can be a:
*   **Logo** (Visual symbol)
*   **Wordmark** (Brand name text)
*   **Symbol** (Icon)
*   **Packaging** (Unique box or bottle shape)
*   **Color** (Specific shade associated with the brand)
*   **Sound** (Audio jingle)

### Difference between ™ and ®
*   **™ (Trademark)**: Use this symbol when you have claimed the mark but haven't received official registration yet. It alerts others that you consider this your brand.
*   **® (Registered)**: Use this ONLY after your trademark is officially registered with the government. It provides full legal protection.

### Why MSMEs need it?
*   **Legal Protection**: Stops others from copying your brand name or logo.
*   **Asset Creation**: A registered trademark is an intangible asset that can be sold, franchised, or licensed.
*   **Trust**: Customers trust registered brands more.
*   **Online Sales**: Essential for brand registry on platforms like Amazon, Flipkart, etc.

### How trademarks build brand value
Trademarks distinguish your quality products from generic or inferior copies, allowing you to build a loyal customer base and charge a premium.

        title: "3. Trademark Classes (NICE Classification)",
        content: `
### What are classes?
Trademarks are categorized into 45 classes (1-34 for goods, 35-45 for services). You must register your mark in the class relevant to your business.

### Why it matters
Registering in the wrong class gives you ZERO protection for your actual products.

### Common MSME Classes
*   **Class 25**: Clothing, Footwear, Headgear (Fashion brands).
*   **Class 29**: Meat, fish, poultry (Food products).
*   **Class 30**: Coffee, tea, rice, spices (Packaged foods).
*   **Class 32**: Beers, mineral waters, fruit drinks (Beverages).
*   **Class 35**: Advertising, Business Management (Retail stores, E-commerce).
*   **Class 41**: Education, Training, Entertainment.
*   **Class 42**: Scientific and technological services (Software companies).
*   **Class 43**: Services for providing food and drink (Restaurants, Cafes).

### The Risks
*   **Brand Confusion**: Customers might buy a competitor's product thinking it's yours.
*   **Legal Objections**: The trademark office will reject your application if it's too similar to an existing mark (Section 11).
*   **Customer Trust**: "Copycat" brands are seen as low quality.
*   **International Scaling**: You cannot expand to other countries if your brand infringes on global marks.

### Real Example

3.  **Visual Check**: Ensure your logo doesn't look like a famous brand.
4.  **Phonetic Check**: Say the names out loud. Do they sound the same?
5.  **Opposition**: Check if similar marks are "Objected" or "Opposed" to understand the risk.

### What MSMEs Can Do
1.  **Cease & Desist Letter**: A formal letter asking the infringer to stop using your mark. Often resolves the issue without court.
2.  **Oppose Trademarks**: Watch the Trademark Journal. If someone tries to register a similar mark, file an "Opposition" within the time limit (usually 4 months).
3.  **Report to Marketplaces**: Amazon, Flipkart, and Instagram have "Brand Infringement" forms to take down fake listings.
4.  **Customs Enforcement**: Register your brand with Customs to stop import/export of fake goods.
